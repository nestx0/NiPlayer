## Features

This is my first project, so its kind of simple. It's a basic MP3 player that uses many Qt Objects, dynamic memory and i/o from text files. It comes with some basic functionalities to make it usable:

- Skip to next or previous song
- Play/Pause functionality
- Display current song title
- Movable slider to seek any part of the song
- Add and remove song buttons
- Number of loaded songs (currently only in Spanish)
- Shuffle and random modes
- Show the full list of all the songs loaded (available by clicking the title of the current song, then you can select any song to play)
- Random changing images for each song (most of them are cute cats)

## Future Features

- Support for different playlists instead of only one
- Multi-file selection when adding songs
- Volume bar
- And more as i get more ideas!!
