## Features

This is my first project, so its kind of simple. It's a basic MP3 player that uses many Qt Objects, dynamic memory and i/o from text files. It comes with some basic functionalities to make it usable:

- Skip to the next song or come back
- Play/Pause
- Text for de current song
- Movable slider to play any part of the song
- Add/Remove song buttons
- Number of loaded songs (currently only in Spanish)
- List of all the songs loaded (available by clicking the title of the current song, then you can tap the song you want to hear)
- Random changing images for each song (most of them are cute cats)
